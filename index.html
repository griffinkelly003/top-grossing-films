        <p><b>New York</b> -- Though films like Bong Joon-ho's "Parasite" receive praise and awards for its contributions to cinema, it's blockbuster adventure movies that have the most success financially.
        </p>

        <p><a href="https://www.boxofficemojo.com/chart/top_lifetime_gross/?area=XWW">The top ten highest-grossing films of all time</a> typically involve big stakes -- Thanos is looking to wipe out half the universe or the Empire has another Death
          Star. "Avengers: Endgame" sits at the top with roughly $2.8 billion at the box
          office.</p>

        <p>Spencer Harrison of the Harvard Business Review says Marvel movies are like puzzels in which "moviegoers become active participants within a larger experience."</p>

        <p>"Marvel systematically builds anticipation for its coming films by putting 'Easter eggs' in its current releases that suggest a future product without giving away the story. The most obvious example is its famous post-credits scenes."</p>

        <p>Disney owns eight of the top-grossing films. However, James Cameron's "Avatar" and "Titanic" were acquired after Disney purchased 21st Century Fox studios in 2019.</p>
